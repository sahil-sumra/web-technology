                            In ancient India, the term "buddha" is referred to an enlightened being, and while there has
                            long
                            been a debate about the exact year when Siddhartha Gautama, now known as Lord Buddha, the
                            founder of
                            Buddhism, was born, legends about Lord Buddha's journey to enlightenment affirm that India
                            was
                            his
                            true home. Lord Buddha was born into a royal family in Kapilvastu, today believed to
                            comprise
                            the
                            villages of Piprahwa, Ganvaria and Salagarh in Uttar Pradesh. Siddhartha Gautama's early
                            life
                            was
                            one of luxury and plenitude. Lord Buddha's life changed when he made a short trip into the
                            world
                            and
                            saw a common man in suffering. When Lord Buddha saw the struggles and vagaries of life in
                            the
                            visages of his people, he renounced his family and all royal comforts, deciding to lead the
                            life
                            of
                            an ascetic. Lord Buddha's life in meditation started in Pragbodhi in Bihar where Pragbodhi
                            is
                            believed to be the site where he meditated with severe penance for six years.
